# Grill me

## Request

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Instructions

Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this request until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one.

Ask the questions once at a time.

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.

For each question, give three approaches for me to choose, and recommend the most suitable one to me.

<HARD-GATE>
Do not use the provided ask question tool for these questions. Just ask me questions in the conversation.
